Quick and dirty python program to get the password for freevpn.
It requires pyperclip. I also installed xclip based on the suggestions from the pyperclip page.
It has only been tested on my bodhi linux install.
Pyperclip download: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyperclip/
xclip source: https://sourceforge.net/projects/xclip/
Debian based distros should be able to sudo apt-get install xclip
